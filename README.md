# Overview

As a software engineer seeking to enhance my skills and understanding of Kotlin, I developed a software application to manage notes using Kotlin's syntax and features.

The software, a simple console-based note management application, allows users to add, view, edit, and delete notes. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, user input handling, and basic error checking.

My purpose in writing this software was to gain a deeper understanding of Kotlin's syntax, particularly in the context of creating a functional and interactive application. I aimed to demonstrate effective usage of Kotlin's classes, functions, control flow constructs, and collections.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools:

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
Kotlin Version: Kotlin 1.4.32

# Useful Websites


- [Kotlin Official Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Kotlin Standard Library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/)

# Future Work

In future iterations of this software, I plan to:

- Implement a more robust error handling mechanism to handle unexpected user input.
- Enhance the user interface to provide a more intuitive and interactive experience.
- Implement persistent storage for the notes to allow data retention between program executions.
- Add search functionality to allow users to search for specific notes based on titles or content.
